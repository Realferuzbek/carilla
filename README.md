## Carilla Dashboard Prototype

A UI-rich dashboard for laptop users plus thumb-first phone navigation for Carilla’s tuning hub. Every surface is wired to a “Coming Soon” state while the full experiences are built.

### What’s inside
- Laptop dashboard with tuning hero, telemetry placeholder, and feature tiles labeled “Coming Soon.”
- Mobile-ready bottom navigation for Tune, Reels, Chat, and Profile, also marked “Coming Soon.”
- Interactive toast that confirms the “Coming Soon” state when tapping/clicking any feature.

### Run it locally
1) Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser (no build or dependencies required).
2) Resize the window below 720px to view the phone navigation bar.

### File map
- `frontend/index.html` — self-contained HTML/CSS/JS for the dashboard and mobile nav preview.
